# Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is designed to help beginners learn the basics of JavaScript, including variables, data types, operators, control structures, and DOM manipulation.

## About the Project

This Tic-Tac-Toe game is a simple web application that allows two players to play the game interactively. The project was built as a learning exercise to understand the fundamentals of JavaScript and how it can be used to create interactive elements on a webpage.

## Features

- **Interactive Game Board**: A 3x3 grid where players can click to place their marks (X or O).
- **Turn-Based Play**: The game alternates turns between two players.
- **Win Detection**: The game checks for win conditions (rows, columns, diagonals) and displays the winner.
- **Draw Detection**: If all cells are filled without a winner, the game detects a draw.
- **Reset Functionality**: Players can reset the game board and start a new game.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the game.
- **CSS**: For styling the game board and other elements.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the game logic and interactivity.

## Setup and Usage

To get started with the Tic-Tac-Toe project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd tic-tac-toe
    ```

3. **Open `index.html` in your web browser**:
    ```bash
    open index.html
    ```

You can also directly open the `index.html` file by double-clicking it in your file explorer.

## How to Play

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Player 1 is assigned 'X', and Player 2 is assigned 'O'.
3. Players take turns clicking on the empty cells to place their mark.
4. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
5. If all nine cells are filled and no player has won, the game is declared a draw.
6. Click the "Reset" button to start a new game.

## Challenges Faced

- **Understanding JavaScript Basics**: Getting familiar with JavaScript syntax, variables, data types, and operators was initially challenging.
- **Event Handling**: Learning to use event listeners to capture and respond to user actions required practice.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Implementing dynamic updates to the HTML structure based on the game state was a new concept that required careful attention.
- **Game Logic**: Writing the logic for win detection, draw detection, and managing game flow was a critical part of the development process.

## Inferences

Through this project, the following key concepts were learned:

- How to use JavaScript to add interactivity to a webpage.
- The importance of control structures (`if-else`, `switch-case`) in managing game logic.
- How to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript to update the user interface dynamically.
- The role of functions in organizing code for better readability and reusability.
